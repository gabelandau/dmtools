# Dungeon Master Tools
This application, written in PHP (using the Laravel framework) and JavaScript (using the Vue.js framework) is a collection of tools to help Dungeons and Dragons dungeon masters run their games more effectively.

When complete, it will have the following components:
1. A combat tracker complete with automatic rolling, damage and condition tracking, action macros, etc.
2. The ability to show a map on a separate window with fog of war enabled, as well as move player and NPC tokens around the map. Tokens have status bars and initiative order markers.
3. Probably more!

## Development
If you're familiar with Laravel and Vue, you can probably get this app up and running yourself. When development is more progressed, detailed instructions for forking this repository and making your own version will be made. For now, please feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you would like.
